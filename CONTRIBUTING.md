# Contributing to Vibespec

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Vibespec! This project follows its own workflow, so contributions must follow the specs-first approach.

## üéØ Quick Start

1. Fork the repository
2. Clone your fork: `git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/vibespec.git`
3. Install Vibespec in the project: `./install.sh .`
4. Create a feature branch: `git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name`
5. Follow the Vibespec workflow for your contribution

## üìã Contribution Workflow

All contributions must follow the Vibespec workflow:

### 1. Create Specifications

Before any code changes, create specs for your contribution:

```bash
mkdir -p specs/your-feature
```

Create three files:

#### specs/your-feature/requirements.md
- Describe WHAT you're adding/changing
- Use EARS format for requirements
- Include acceptance criteria

#### specs/your-feature/design.md
- Explain HOW you'll implement it
- Include technical decisions
- Note any breaking changes

#### specs/your-feature/tasks.md
- Break down implementation steps
- Include time estimates
- Link tasks to requirements

### 2. Get Approval

1. Create a draft PR with just the specs
2. Label it with `specs-review`
3. Wait for maintainer feedback
4. Update specs based on feedback

### 3. Implement

After specs are approved:
1. Implement following your tasks.md
2. Update task checkboxes as you progress
3. Run tests: `./test-workflow.sh`
4. Update documentation if needed

## üöÄ Types of Contributions

## üß™ Testing

Before submitting:
