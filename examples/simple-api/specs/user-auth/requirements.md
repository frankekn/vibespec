# Requirements: User Authentication

## Overview

Implement a secure user authentication system that allows users to register, login, and manage their sessions using JWT tokens.

## Requirements

### REQ-001: User Registration
**Priority**: High  
**Type**: Functional

When a new user submits valid registration information, the system shall create a user account and return a success response within 3 seconds.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
1. Given a valid email and password, when the user submits registration, then a new account is created
2. The email address shall be unique across all users
3. The password shall be at least 8 characters long
4. The password shall be hashed using bcrypt before storage
5. The system shall return appropriate error messages for validation failures

### REQ-002: User Login
**Priority**: High  
**Type**: Functional

When a user submits valid credentials, the system shall authenticate the user and return a JWT token within 2 seconds.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
1. Given correct email and password, when the user logs in, then a valid JWT token is returned
2. The JWT token shall expire after 24 hours
3. The token shall include user ID and email in the payload
4. Failed login attempts shall return a generic "Invalid credentials" message
5. The system shall implement rate limiting of 5 attempts per 15 minutes

### REQ-003: Password Security
**Priority**: High  
**Type**: Non-functional

While storing and processing passwords, when handling authentication, the system shall ensure password security.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
1. Passwords shall never be stored in plain text
2. Passwords shall be hashed using bcrypt with a cost factor of 10
3. Password comparison shall use timing-safe comparison functions
4. Password reset tokens shall expire after 1 hour

### REQ-004: Session Management
**Priority**: Medium  
**Type**: Functional

When a user has a valid JWT token, the system shall allow access to protected resources.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
1. Given a valid JWT token, when accessing protected endpoints, then access is granted
2. Given an expired JWT token, when accessing protected endpoints, then a 401 error is returned
3. Given an invalid JWT token, when accessing protected endpoints, then a 401 error is returned
4. The system shall provide a token refresh endpoint

### REQ-005: Input Validation
**Priority**: High  
**Type**: Non-functional

When receiving user input for authentication operations, the system shall validate and sanitize all inputs.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
1. Email addresses shall be validated against RFC 5322 format
2. SQL injection attempts shall be prevented through parameterized queries
3. XSS attempts shall be prevented through input sanitization
4. All validation errors shall be logged for security monitoring
